            CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.

            External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.
        </li>
        <br>
    </ol>
    <p class="head ital bold">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</p>
    <ul class="text font">
        <li>
           Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements 
        </li>
        <li>
            Internal - by using a style element in the head section
        </li>
        <li>
            External - by using a link elements to link to an external CSS file.
        </li>
        <li >
            The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <font class="mark bold">in this tutorial we will use inline  and internal styles,</font> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text">
        When comparing CSS class vs ID , the differnceis that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by Javascript.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        In CSS, selectors are used to target a species element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.
